## Done


in central london getting 300+ ble and 60+ wifi!
many do identify as lime and forrest bikes.  They should have a separate tone.

Give them static random directions for now and do simple stereo based on head rotation.

Im not getting dynamic panning. The sources do not rotate as I rotate the phone.

the single test tone should rotate as the phone rotates too
