awesome!  How often can the scanning be done?  Can sources be checked individually as well as background global sweeps?  If so I would check overall every 10 seconds and for changes to known sources - for moving lime bikes or walking people every 2 seconds

can the display show more rapid ble changes?  Show the 4 strongest signals only otherwise sumarize.  Compactify so more fits onto 1 page
